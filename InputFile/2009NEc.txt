He has a small concrete back porch that is low and floods when there is lots of rain.  He dug a narrow trench along his porch all along this fence to the alley and wants City to cut into the concrete alley to drain out the water.  I told him we could not cut into the alley (other neighbors would complain) and that I would refer this concern to Flooding to see if there are any recommendations they can give to him to help him with drainage problem.

Mr. Metcalf states that staff from the STR PWT and EBS departments have come out; however no one is willing to take responsibility to correct the problem.  Mr. Metcalf states the running water from the Community Gardens irrigation system is deteriorating their community wall and has destroyed his driveway.  The running water goes into the soil and percolates run into the street in front of his home and stand for five to six months.  Mr. Metcalf vehemently states that something must be done to correct this problem as this is City water that is damaging his property and others and it should not be the responsibility of the citizens to make corrections to the drainage ditch and irrigation system.  Note: the following staff persons have visited the citizen's property but have not offered a solution to this longstanding problem: Yousuf Bawany PWT; Ray Sottilare EBS; and Michael Alford District Manager STR Northeast Station.  ,DEC 08 2009 01:48 PM,,PLOVE

Citizen asks that immediate attention be given in removing the excess waste of broken concrete from the storm water drainage system so that the flow of water moves properly.   Citizen states on November 15 heavy rains flooded his home with three inches of water .  Citizen states that he got into water through the manhole that reached his shoulder - to locate the logged sewer outlet to no avail.  On 11/16 city staff cleaned out the drain box and found the drain outlet is substantially constrict by hardened concrete within the outlet in the bottom of the drain box and in the drain pipe itself.  The opening into the drain line is constricted at least four inches smaller than it should be according to the City workman.  There is evidence of concrete repair work having been performed in recent months on the alley surface leading to this storm drain and one will suspect the concrete contractor has carelessly washed concrete down the drain while cleaning out their truck after repair the alley.  12/14/09 Per Manager this needs to be referred to Flood control for CCTV to locate concrete obstruction in inlet,DEC 10 2009 10:17 AM,Outcome Follow-On,MPENA

The contractor failed to connect the kitchen pipeline to the refrigerator which caused flooding of the citizen's home with an estimated cost of $7000 in damage.  Citizen desperately needs the City to intervene on his behalf in getting the contractor and/or their Insurance company to pay for the damage since the City is responsible for hiring the contractor who did the work.  The citizen has made several calls to the contractor and to their insurance company (Frison Insurance Agency 5902 Windmier ; 214.887.6362) over the course of four months but has not received a returned call from any of these people.  Citizen states that he spoke with a Sheila Smallwood (241.670.3396) in the Purchasing Department who is aware of this problem; and has also spoke with people in the minor home repair program but no one has made any attempts to intervene on his behalf.  Councilmember Jerry Allen requests immediate attention to this longstanding problem.,DEC 11 2009 09:30 AM,,PLOVE

He has a small concrete back porch that is low and floods when there is lots of rain.  He dug a narrow trench along his porch all along this fence to the alley and wants City to cut into the concrete alley to drain out the water.  I told him we could not cut into the alley (other neighbors would complain) and that I would refer this concern to Flooding to see if there are any recommendations they can give to him to help him with drainage problem.,DEC 17 2009 07:18 AM,,TWOVARELA

Although the City ordinance is such that it should be fenced on three sides; Mr. Allen would like Code to take a look at perhaps relocating the dumpsters to a spot where it is hidden without having to put a fence up.  These recycle dumpsters are generally fundraisers for the PTA so sensitivity is important.  Please Note: Schools are out on winter break until January 2nd so no one will be there to talk.          ,DEC 21 2009 11:43 AM,,PLOVE
