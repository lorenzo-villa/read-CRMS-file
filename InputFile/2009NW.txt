I do not think trimming will do much to improve visibility (unless they are left bald).  Also I do not want to cut down the three Crepe Myrtles unless there is no alternative.   Sign is at near intersection of 8500 Bluebonnet Rd @ Canyon Rd.  Any advice?  I will respond to citizen's letter once I here from you.  ,DEC 16 2009 10:48 AM,,CSWAIN

The crew was there most of one day and they managed to get the lighted crosswalk working again!  Unfortunately only three bulbs are lighting when the button is pressed.  I know that they were all working before the disastrous "cut" in the concrete.  Of course they removed at least two in the "cut".  At any rate I doubt that replacing six to eight bulbs will be an huge expense and hopefully the bulbs are available locally and can be easily replaced. This has taken a long time but I want to thank you both for your persistence in getting this up and going again! It is an important piece of security on this very busy street!   It just blows the mind that such a simple repair could take so long and involve so many people with doubts and hesitations in repairing this great crosswalk.  It's a sad statement for the City of Dallas and it's just so typical.   Hopefully the two of you can improve that also!  You're both great representatives for our districts and neighborhoods. ,DEC 22 2009 09:12 AM,,CSWAIN

If you stop at Harry Hines then go the speed limit you will have to stop again just up the street at Shady Trail Ables or Composite. The timing should ensure better traffic flow. It is only causing more needless idling and air pollution not to mention frustration. This is worse at 7:30am. There are hardly any cars coming from Shady Trail Ables or Composite this time of the morning so the traffic on Walnut Hill should not have to stop very often at these signals.,DEC 28 2009 10:08 AM,,CSR
